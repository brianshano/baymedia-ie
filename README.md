# gatsby-starter-default
The default Gatsby starter

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/)

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
```
gatsby new gatsby-example-site
```

`gatsby develop` — Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible at localhost:8000
Try editing the JavaScript pages in src/pages. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

`gatsby build` — Gatsby will perform an optimized production build for your site generating static HTML and per-route JavaScript code bundles.

`gatsby serve` — Gatsby starts a local HTML server for testing your built site.
